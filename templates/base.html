    <h2>Welcome & About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome and thank you for viewing my website. This site is a compilation of projects that I've worked on in &
        outside the
        classroom. I'm proudly part of the class of 2023 at Saint Michael's College. I've had a great and successful
        educational
        experience that has made me increasingly curious and excited to learn and apply that knowledge. Feel free to
        check out
        my work and contact me with any questions. You can also find me and many of these projects on GitHub. Thank you!
    </p>
